It was good for me to fulfill this task. I learned while doing it. I gained practicality at some points. 
I think that the person who does this task will not have any problems in automation.
For some scenarios, the text box does not accept the same string expressions we send, so it fails. 
Therefore, we have to run Scenario_02 once. If other testcases fail, our test will pass when it is run for the second or third time.
To run our tests, we can run the tags in the future file file by pasting them into the tag section of the runner class.
I am always ready to contact you if there is a place that is not understood.
